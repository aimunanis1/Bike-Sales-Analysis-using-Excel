- **Key Insight**: By analyzing the performance across different years, I could spot patterns in **growth** or **decline**, helping to identify periods that may have required more marketing efforts or a change in strategy.  
- **Takeaway**: Fluctuations in revenue can provide clues on what to focus on in future years.

### 3. **Revenue by Age Group**
The next chart breaks down **revenue** by **age group**. This is valuable for understanding which demographic groups are spending the most on bicycles. 💥👶👵

- **Key Insight**: The **Adult (35-64)** and **Young Adults (25-34)** age groups were the top performers in terms of sales.  
- **Takeaway**: While these groups are thriving, **younger consumers** (under 25) might need more targeted marketing to capture their attention.
